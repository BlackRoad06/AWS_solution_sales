<h1>AWS solution for a client</h1>
<p>Image 1 shows an AWS cloud solution set up for a client who owns a globally expanding online business. The client connects to AWS using a VPN connection from their corporate network to carry out sales operations and manage their data on the cloud. Their customers can connect through a public network to access their products.  The solution contains automatically scaling web servers to handle network traffic as it increases or decreases aiding them to grow their volume of transactions globally with the benefits of savings in cost. The solution also provides resiliency and security of confidential data by hosting them in private subnets across different availability zones.
